## Celest

[Celest](https://celest.dev) is the Flutter cloud platform. We enable Flutter and Dart developers to declaratively define their backend infrastructure in Dart.

Our initial CLI release is available to download [here](https://celest.dev/download). It includes the full experience of serverless functions in a local environment. To learn more about our CLI and all the features, visit our [documentation](https://celest.dev/docs).

And to stay up-to-date on the future of Celest, including managed deployments, join our waitlist at [celest.dev](https://celest.dev).
