## 1.0.0

The first release of Celest V1! This release includes:

- **Celest Data**

    Celest Data is a brand new database offering from Celest built off of SQLite and [Drift](https://pub.dev/packages/drift).

    To get started with Celest Data, add a new `Database` component to your Celest project and point it at your Drift schema.

    ```dart
    import 'package:celest/celest.dart';
    import 'package:celest_backend/src/database/task_database.dart';

    const project = Project(name: 'tasks');

    const tasksDatabase = Database(
      schema: Schema.drift(TaskDatabase),
    );
    ```

    When you run Celest locally, Celest Data will use SQLite to store your data. And when you deploy your Celest project, Celest Data 
    will automatically switch to using Celest Data backed by [Turso](https://turso.tech/).

- **Celest Cloud Auth**

    [Celest Cloud Auth](https://pub.dev/packages/celest_cloud_auth) is an open-source backend service for authenticating users and authorizing access to resources. It is built on the [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en) policy engine and Celest Data.

    Now, when adding [Auth]() to your Celest project, Celest will automatically generate the necessary code to integrate Celest Cloud 
    Auth into your project so you can start authenticating users and controlling the resources they can access.

    ```dart
    import 'package:celest/celest.dart';

    const project = Project(name: 'my-project');

    const auth = Auth(
      providers: [
          AuthProvider.email(),
      ],
    );
    ```

- **Self-Hosting**

    Celest now supports self-hosting your Celest project. You can run your Celest project on your own server or cloud provider. 
    This allows you to have full control over your backend and data.

    The new `celest build` command will automatically generate a `Dockerfile` which you can deploy to any server of your choice.

- **Improved Developer Experience**

    We have made several improvements to the developer experience, including better error messages, improved documentation, and a 
    new Dart analyzer plugin which helps you more seamlessly navigate your code. Now, when using the `Go To Definition` feature in
    your IDE, you will be taken directly from your frontend to your backend code.

- **...and much more on the Roadmap!**

    We are excited to continue building out the Celest platform and have many more features planned for the future. Our initial release
    of Celest V1 provides the foundation for many new features to come include server-side rendering of Flutter app, better integration
    of your Data models and Auth policies, Web Hosting, Storage, and much more!
