# celest_project

A Flutter project showing examples of connecting to openAI. This project demonstrates:

1. How to build Functions.
2. Using custom model types with Celest functions.
3. Connecting your Flutter app to your Celest backend.
4. Using the Celest backend to pass configurable values such as "AI model types", so that you can update them without deploying another version of your app.


## Getting Started

Navigate to the example `openai` in your console, and run the following command:

```shell
$ flutter pub get
```

Download celest from the [Celest download page](https://celest.dev/download). Then, complete the installation using the downloaded file.

Navigate in your console to the `openai/celest` folder in your console, and run the following command to install the needed dependencies:

```shell
$ celest start
```

Keep this command running in your console, and then run your Flutter app.

Enjoy experimenting with Celest!
