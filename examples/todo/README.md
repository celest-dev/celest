## Getting Started

Clone or download this repo. Then, navigate to the example `todo` folder in your console, and run the following command:

```shell
$ flutter pub get
```

Download Celest from the [Celest download page](https://celest.dev/download), and run the installer to get the Celest CLI.

You are now ready to run your backend locally.

In your console, and run the following command to start the local Celest environment:
